Inputs: price(NumericSeries), length(NumericSimple);
Vars: halvedLength(0), sqrRootLength(0);

{
 Original equation is:
 ---------------------
 waverage(2*waverage(close,period/2)-waverage(close,period), SquareRoot(Period)
 Implementation below is more efficient with lengthy Weighted Moving Averages.
 In addition, the length needs to be converted to an integer value after it is halved and
 its square root is obtained in order for this to work with Weighted Moving Averaging
}
if length > 0 then begin
	if ((ceiling(length / 2) - (length / 2))  <= 0.5) then
		halvedLength = ceiling(length / 2)
	else
		halvedLength = floor(length / 2);

	if ((ceiling(SquareRoot(length)) - SquareRoot(length))  <= 0.5) then
		sqrRootLength = ceiling(SquareRoot(length))
	else
		sqrRootLength = floor(SquareRoot(length));

	Value1 = 2 * WAverage(price, halvedLength);
	Value2 = WAverage(price, length);
	Value3 = WAverage((Value1 - Value2), sqrRootLength);
	jtHMA = Value3;
end else
	jtHMA = price;

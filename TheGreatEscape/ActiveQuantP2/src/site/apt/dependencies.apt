Dependencies

	Depending on what you use, P2 has different requirements. 
	
	In principle it requires: recent JDK, Maven 2+, SVN, MySQL5+

        If you want to use the QuoteRecorder, DataRelay, etc you need to have an {{{http://mq.dev.java.net}openMQ}} server available where to relay data through.
